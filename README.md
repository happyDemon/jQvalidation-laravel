# jQvalidation-laravel
Extra validation rule for jQueryValidation that translate well to laravel

Documentation can be found [here](http://jqvalidation.happydemon.xyz/)

## Progress

While all the ruels that are present do work, I still need to add image dimensions rule and propper array validation support.

Until then I'll keep this repo's releases under 1.0
